    <h1>Privacy</h1>
    <p>
        This site is produced by HealthEventsLive.com This policy applies to all sites produced 
        by HealthEventsLive.com. This policy does not cover information collected on sites linked 
        to/from HealthEventsLive.com sites.
    </p>
    <p>
        HealthEventsLive.com sites are committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual 
        needs and, at the same time, to protecting your privacy. The following is a summary of the various 
        ways we treat the information you provide us while accessing our sites:
    </p>
    <h3>1. What information does HealthEventsLive.com gather/track about you?</h3>
    <p>
        HealthEventsLive.com only collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge 
        and consent. For instance, when you register for our services, complete a survey or subscribe to our 
        publications, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, or phone number. 
        Information such as your age or gender may also be requested.
    </p>
    <p>
        HealthEventsLive.com uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, 
        if you subscribe for our health alerts, we will use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice. 
        We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, or to 
        improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        HealthEventsLive.com also logs IP addresses (the location of your computer on the Internet) for systems 
        administration and troubleshooting purposes. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.
    </p>
    <h3>2. What does HealthEventsLive.com do internally with the information it gathers/tracks?</h3>
    <p>
        HealthEventsLive.com may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure relative user 
        interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as 
        to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. In performance of these statistical 
        analyses, we will disclose information to third parties in aggregate form.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the e-mail addresses provided at registration, HealthEventsLive.com periodically sends promotional 
        e-mail to its registered users about services offered by HealthEventsLive.com and its advertisers. A user 
        can indicate on the registration form that he or she does not wish to receive e-mail information from 
        HealthEventsLive.com or its advertisers.
    </p>
    <h3>3. With whom does HealthEventsLive.com share the information it gathers/tracks?</h3>
    <p>
        HealthEventsLive.com may share information with carefully selected companies who we think can offer 
        services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your information shared with these 
        companies, write to us at <a href="mailto:info@HealthEventsLive.com">info@HealthEventsLive.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although we will only share information with carefully selected companies, we cannot guarantee that your 
        personal information will never be disclosed to other third parties. By way of example, without limiting 
        the foregoing, we may be forced to disclose information to the government under certain circumstances, 
        or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or might 
        disclose your information to other sites as part of offering additional functionality to you. Additionally, 
        we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your personal information to private entities, law enforcement or 
        other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, 
        we do not promise that your personal information will remain private.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Is HealthEventsLive.com responsible for the content or the privacy policies of Web sites to which it may link?</h3>
    <p>
        No, those sites are responsible for maintaining their own privacy policy.
    </p>
    <h3>5. What is a cookie?</h3>
    <p>
        A "cookie" is a small piece of information that a Web site can store in a designated file on your computer. 
        It can be used, among other things, to identify you when you log in to a Web site. When you visit a site, 
        that site can access only the information which it stored in your cookie -- not information put in your 
        cookie by other sites.
        Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed 
        by advertisers.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't want cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you not to accept them. 
        We don't recommend using this option, though; it makes browsing our site a less enjoyable experience. For 
        instance, when you turn off your cookie option, you may have to enter information every time you visit the 
        site, or a page may no longer be customized to your specifications.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Will I receive unsolicited e-mail if I accept your cookies?</h3>
    <p>
        No. Acceptance of cookies on our Web site does not result in your receiving any additional e-mail from us 
        or from our advertisers. As noted in the above answer 2, when you registered, you chose whether to receive 
        promotional e-mail from HealthEventsLive.com or from our advertisers.
    </p>
    <h3>7. How is my information kept secure?</h3>
    <p>
        We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewalls, secure sockets layer, and password protection, where appropriate. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        MINORS: HealthEventsLive.com sites are not intended for use by children, especially those under age 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums, or chatrooms. Minors under the age of 18 are prohibited from making purchases, including subscriptions, on our sites.
If your children disclose information about themselves in our public discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should tell them not to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; notice of changes will appear on this page, so check back often. Any such changes will be prospective, never retroactive.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have concerns or questions about any aspect of this policy, please e-mail our Privacy Policy Coordinator at <a href="mailto:info@HealthEventsLive.com">info@HealthEventsLive.com</a>. We welcome your feedback.
